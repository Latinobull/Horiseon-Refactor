# Horiseon Refactor

## Description

This is my repository on the Horiseon Reactor on making this webpage both accessible and maximizing the Search Engine Optimization. 

### How I Got There
In order to maximize those areas, I added meta elements with descriptions, keywords and viewports. I verified all links and html code were debugged and useful. Changed a majority of the div elements and replaced them with more semantic elements to help others to read and change the code. Also, I added comments in the HTML code to break down each section of the webpage. Alt elements were added to all images in order to help those with bad and/or limited internet and has a trouble time seeing images on there feed. I reformated some of the header elements so they were in order. 

On the CSS side, I combined multiple classes in order to clean up the CSS page. Limited the amount of classes used without destroying the flow and style of the page. I added an @media tag to help those viewing it on smaller devices such as tablets and phones.
